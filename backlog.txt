secure API backend with JWT token
on account settings get user info from user obj stored in Angular

hide alert and message field on all modals, add this to all user forms as error handling

check every input form where username or other ID can be changed, that original value is sent to DB otherwise wont work obviously

Think about ownership in DB, single source of truth --> possibly delete 'owned_users' array from model






User Management
    when changing user details on user management, view in table doesn't update after modal is dismissed with OK

    if current user is ADMIN, needs to see all users.

    filter search at top of page needs to be done

    datepicker doesn't work

    add check for empty user creation (probably generalize into service)

    write services to get rid of duplication (e.g. setRole, setOwner.....)

    New User modal says modify user at top --> do it like role management


Data Management

    Working fine, add address/ delete address needed? (not done yet)
