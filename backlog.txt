secure API backend with JWT token
on account settings get user info from user obj stored in Angular

hide alert and message field on all modals, add this to all user forms as error handling

User Management
    when changing user details on user management, view in table doesn't update after modal is dismissed with OK

    if current user is ADMIN, needs to see all users.

    filter search at top of page needs to be done

    datepicker doesn't work

    add check for empty user creation (probably generalize into service)

    write services to get rid of duplication (e.g. setRole, setOwner.....)


Data Management

    Working fine, add address/ delete address needed? (not done yet)
