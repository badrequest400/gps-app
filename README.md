#GPS App
**(later to be renamed something cool involving dragons and shit)**



##Setup

This is a project built on Node.js, so you will need that installed to do anything.
Back-end and front-end dependencies are managed by **npm** and **bower**.

First install all back-end dependencies including bower. While in the project root:
```npm install
```
Now install all front-end components using bower via npm:
```npm run bower
```


**Start the server**
```node app.js
```

You should be good to go, server is listening on http://localhost:3000
